        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tesla Coil :</strong> The Tesla coil is a transformer used to produre low-current, high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current.</li>
            <li><strong>Tesla Turbine :</strong> The Tesla turbine was an turbine style engine that used combustion to make the disks rotate.</li>
            <li><strong>Tesla Valve :</strong> A Tesla valve is a fixed-geomety passive check valve. It allows fluids to flow prefrentially in one direction without any moving parts.</li>
            <li><strong>Magnifying Transmitter :</strong> The magnifying transmitter is used  to create standing waves of electricity that travel through air and light up flourescent bulbs at a distance up to 1km.</li>
            <li><strong>Niagra Falls Transformer House :</strong> Tesla's system for alternating current worked well and have become the standard for hydroelectrical power.</li>
            <li><strong>Radio :</strong> Tesla used his coils to transmit and receive radio waves up to 50 miles.</li>
            <li><strong>Induction Motor :</strong> The first commutato-free 3 phase induction motor. This type is motor is still used in vacuums, power tools and other appliances.</li> 
            <li><strong>Neon Lamp : Althouh he did not invent neon lights be improved them vastly allowing them to make unique designs and form words.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Alternating Current :</strong> While he is not the inventor of AC power he made it easy to be used.</li>
            <li><strong>Radio Controlled Boat</strong> Tesla invented the Teleautomaton. A small toy boat remote controlled using radio waves.</li>
            <li><strong>Shadowgraph :</strong> Another name for X-rays. Although it was initially developed by someone else; Tesla made improvements to them to render clearer images.</li>
